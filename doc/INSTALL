If you aren't using the `pg_config` on your path (or don't have it on your path), specify the correct one to build against:

        PG_CONFIG=/Library/PostgreSQL/9.5/bin/pg_config make

Or to build with what's on your path, just:

        make

Then install:

       sudo make install

After you've built and installed the artifacts, fire up `psql`:

      postgres=# CREATE EXTENSION ast_postgis;
      CREATE EXTENSION
